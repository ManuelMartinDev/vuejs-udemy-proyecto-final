            Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the
            features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering,
            TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No
            config is needed.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4 text-md">
            You can use React to build your UI, then incrementally adopt Next.js
            features to solve common application requirements such as routing,
            data fetching, and integrations - all while improving the developer
            and end-user experience.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4 text-md">
            Whether youâ€™re an individual developer or part of a larger team, you
            can leverage React and Next.js to build fully interactive, highly
            dynamic, and performant web applications.
